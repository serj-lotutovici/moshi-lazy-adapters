A collection of simple JsonAdapters for [Moshi][moshi].
 
This library acts as an extension to Moshi by providing general purpose, yet useful `JsonAdapter`s 
 that are not present in the main library. Most provided adapters are linked via specialized 
 `JsonQualifier` annotations that alter serialization/deserialization strategies.

##### How To Use It

This library is **not** forcing any of it's own adapters by default. To leverage from any of
 the provided annotations/adapters add their respective factory to your `Moshi.Builder`:

```java
// Creates a Moshi instance with an adapter that will handle the @Wrapped annotations.
Moshi moshi = new Moshi.Builder()
  .add(Wrapped.ADAPTER_FACTORY)
  .build();
```

##### Overall contract

Every declared annotation/adapter in this library (unless specified in the class's documentation)
 supports adapter composition. Which means that no `JsonAdapter.Factory` will short circuit adapter
 construction on it's own annotation, and instead will delegate to the next adapter returned by
 `Moshi`. Meaning that given the following type declaration:
 
```java
interface WebService {
  @GET("/data")
  @Wrapped(path={"result", "data"}) @FirstElement MyData getData();
}

```

The resulting `JsonAdapter` will unwrap a list of `MyData` from the json response and return only 
 the first element of that list.
 
One **important** concept to keep in mind, that the order of declared annotations in the example 
 above **does not have any influence** on the way how the final adapter will be constructed. 
 Instead **the order** of the `JsonAdapter.Factory`'s added to the `Moshi` instance is what plays 
 a major role in overall behavior. Meaning that in order for the example above to satisfy the 
 expected result, one must add the factories in the following order:
 
```
Moshi moshi = new Moshi.Builder()
  .add(Wrapped.ADAPTER_FACTORY)
  .add(FirstElement.ADAPTER_FACTORY)
  .build()

```


Some Lazy Adapters
---

### `@Wrapped`

Some apis enjoy wrapping the response object inside other json objects. This creates a lot of inconvenience
 when it comes to consuming the request. The following example contains a list of a users
 favorite pokemon which is wrapped behind two keys:
 
```json
{
  "favorite_pokemon": {
    "pokemons": [
      "Snorlax",
      "Pikachu",
      "Bulbasaur",
      "Charmander",
      "Squirtle"
    ]
  }
}
```

In the end the consumer is just interested in the names of the pokemon, but the json object forces to create
 a wrapping object, which will contain the list:
 
```java
class FavoritePokemonResponse {
  FavoritePokemon favorite_pokemon;
}

class FavoritePokemon {
  List<String> pokemons;
}
```

A custom adapter would be another option, and `WrappedJsonAdapter` is just the one. By annotating
 the response type with `@Wrapped` and providing the path to the desired list, the need for 
 an additional object is dropped:

```java
// This assumes that Retrofit is used to obtain the response.
interface PokemonService {
  @GET("/pokemon/favorite")
  @Wrapped({"favorite_pokemon", "pokemons"}) Call<List<String>> getFavorite();
}
```

No need for a new class, which results in less code and less methods generated by the consumer code. 
 You can also annotate any field in your response entity and the same rules will apply.


### `@FallbackOnNull`

Primitives are simple and safe. Primitives have also a smaller memory footprint. Some apis may return
 `null` for values that are normally processed as primitives. A safe alternative would be to use
 their boxed counterparts, but that would result in redundant boxing and unboxing. By annotating 
 any primitive field with `@FallbackOnNull` the consumer can specify a default value for the field, 
 in case it's json representation is null.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Pikachu",
    "number_of_wins": 1
  },
  {
    "name": "Magikarp",
    "number_of_wins": null
  } 
]
```

The json above contains a list of pokemon of a user with their names and the number of wins the 
 respective pokemon has obtained during it's trainings of fights. Notice that the 'Magikarp' pokemon
 has `null` wins. Normally the representing POJO would declare the filed as `Integer`, but #perfmatters.
 With `@FallbackOnNull` the `Pokemon` object can be declared as:

```java
class Pokemon {
  String name;
  @FallbackOnNull int number_of_wins;
}
```

If the incoming value would be `null` the `number_of_wins` field would default to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`,
 this can be altered by providing an alternative fallback:

```java
  @FallbackOnNull(fallbackInt = -1) int number_of_wins;
```

See [FallbackOnNull's documentation](../master/src/main/java/com/serjltt/moshi/adapters/FallbackOnNull.java) 
 for a full reference.


List of provided Adapters
---

* **DefaultOnDataMismatchAdapter** - Allows the consumer to provided a default fallback value for any type.
* **SerializeNulls (annotation)** - Serializes a value even if it's `null`;
* **FirstElement (annotation)** - Deserializes only the first element of a list.
* **LastElement (annotation)** - Deserializes only the last element of a list.
* **ElementAt (annotation)** - Deserializes an element from a specified position of a list.
* **FallbackOnNull (annotation)** - Fallbacks to a default value in case the json field is `null`.
* **FallbackEnum (annotation)** - Fallbacks to a default enum value if the parsed value can not be matched to an existing one.
* **Wrapped (annotation)** - Unwraps a json object under the specified path when parsing, and wraps it when serializing to json.
* **SerializeOnl (annotation)y** - Only serializes the annotated field, and ignores it during deserialization.
* **DeserializeOnly (annotation)** - Only deserializes the annotated field, and ignores it during serialization.
* **Transient (annotation)** - (Targets methods only) indicates that a field should be ignored for serialization/deserialization.
* **SerializeOnlyNonEmpty (annotation)** - Will serialize a collection or array only if it contains at-least one value.
